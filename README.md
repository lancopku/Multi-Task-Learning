This is a general purpose software for online multi-task learning. The online multi-task learning is mainly based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) training. The work is described in (Sun et al., TKDE 2013). [[Tutorial]](OMT.tu.pdf)

Main features:
 - Developed with C#
 - High accuracy on the human activity recognition tasks (Sun et al., TKDE 2013)
 - General purpose (it is task-independent & trainable using your own tagged corpus)
 - Support SGD training & Limited-memory BFGS training
 - Support various evaluation metrics, including token-accuracy, string-accuracy, & F-score
